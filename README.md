Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Linting

Run `ng lint` to lint the project using ESLint. To automatically fix linting errors, run `npm run lint:fix`.
